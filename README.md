# Hi there, I'm Ninad Bhat 👋

## About Me
I am a PhD candidate at the Australian National University, specialising in Applied Machine Learning for Materials Design. During my PhD, I've worked as a software engineer at the [Software Innovation Institute](https://sii.anu.edu.au/) and [Instaclustr by NetApp](https://www.instaclustr.com/), and spent time as a research intern at the [Materials Data Science and Informatics (IAS-9)](https://www.fz-juelich.de/en/ias/ias-9) in Germany and [Nanocube](https://www.nanocube.com.au/) in Australia. I also had the opportunity to participate in Google Summer of Code 2021 with [AiiDA](https://www.aiida.net/), where I developed the [AiiDA-RESTAPI](https://github.com/aiidateam/aiida-restapi). I hold a Bachelor's and Master's degree from the Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay.
