# Hi there, I'm Ninad Bhat 👋

## About Me  
I'm a Machine Learning Engineer at [Springboards.ai](https://springboards.ai/), where I focus on benchmarking and fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs) for creative applications. My work involves evaluating LLM performance, ensuring high-quality and diverse responses, and improving output through prompt engineering and custom fine-tuning. I'm particularly interested in enhancing response variation, coherence, and creativity in generative tasks.

Previously, I completed a PhD in Applied Machine Learning at the Australian National University, where I built tools for materials design using AI. I've worked as a Software Engineer at the [Software Innovation Institute](https://sii.anu.edu.au/) and [Instaclustr by NetApp](https://www.instaclustr.com/), and held research internships at [IAS-9, Forschungszentrum Jülich](https://www.fz-juelich.de/en/ias/ias-9) in Germany and [Nanocube](https://www.nanocube.com.au/) in Australia.  

In 2021, I was selected for [Google Summer of Code](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/), contributing to [AiiDA](https://www.aiida.net/) by developing the [AiiDA-RESTAPI](https://github.com/aiidateam/aiida-restapi).  
I hold a Bachelor's and Master's degree from IIT Bombay.
